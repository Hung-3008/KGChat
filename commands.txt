It is necessary to identify the proportion of residents of Saudi Arabia which undergo for hearing screening and identify predictors of hearing loss. Therefore, we conducted this study to identify predictors of the hearing screening among residents of Saudi Arabia.\n\nMethods A cross-sectional study was undertaken, and an electronic questionnaire was administered to 14,239 patients who visited primary health care centers. Primary health care centers were selected using a random sampling technique. Data was collected on hearing screening and other sociodemographic and behavioural factors along with other co-morbidities. We performed multiple logistic regressions to identify predictors that were significantly associated with hearing screening. We performed analysis using SPSS version 26.0 for Windows and reported adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% CIs.',
