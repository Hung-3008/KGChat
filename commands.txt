The globin moiety consists of two alpha and two beta chains.\n* **Glycated Hemoglobin A** (CONCEPT): Products of non-enzymatic reactions between GLUCOSE and HEMOGLOBIN A, occurring as a minor fraction of the hemoglobin components of human erythrocytes. Hemoglobin A1c is hemoglobin A with glucose covalently bound to the terminal VALINE of the beta chain. Glycated hemoglobin A is used as an index ...\n* **Glucose** (CONCEPT): A primary source of energy for living organisms.
